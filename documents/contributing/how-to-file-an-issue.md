# How to File an Issue

The GitHub [issue tracker][0] is the preferred channel for bug reports,
documentation, feature requests and [submitting pull requests](pull-requests.md).

To resolve your issue, please select the appropriate category:

- Documentation
- Feature Requests

Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests.
The [discourse and forums](CONTRIBUTING.md#contact) are the
better places to request help.


## Labelling the issues

Issue labels are a tool in GitHub that are used to group issues into one or
more categories.  Labeling issues helps by identifying:

- good issues for new contributors to work on
- reported and confirmed bugs
- feature requests
- duplicate issues
- issues that are stalled or blocked
- the status of an open issue
- the topic or subject matter of the issue

When an issue is created -- and later examined -- this is a good time to check
that its label is sensible, and to add an other labels that are helpful -- and
to remove labels that do not apply. 

You can see a list of this project's [labels (and their descriptions)][1].


## Special Note on Issues

If an issue is affecting you, start at the top of this list and complete as many
tasks on the list as you can:

1. If there is an issue and you can add more detail, write a comment describing
    how the problem is affecting you, OR if you can, write up a work-around or
    improvement for the issue
2. If there _is not_ an issue, write the most complete description of what's
   happening
3. Offer to help fix the issue (and it is totally expected that you ask for
   help; open-source maintainers want to help contributors)
4. [Deliver a well-crafted, tested PR](pull-requests.md)
