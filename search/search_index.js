A pull request is how you submit your changes to the project. Before you make any changes, please read the contributing page for information regarding contributions to project overall. This will help you in making your changes fit within the project and its style; as well as the steps you must do before creating a pull-request. What is a Pull Request (PR)? \u00b6 As described above, a pull request is how you submit changes to this project. It is a request that the project pull in your changes. Here's how the folks at GitHub define a pull request : Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. The pull request allows others to review the changes, test them, and provide feedback -- including requests to makes to the changees, so that they better fit into the project. Pull Request Process \u00b6 Once you have completed the changes on your local development environment, tested them, and so fprth, the next steps is to create a pull request. Be sure to check the contributing guide for additional steps and tips to ensure that your changes will fit with the project. When you are ready to generate a pull request, either for preliminary review, or for consideration of merging into the project you must first push your local topic branch back up to GitHub: git push origin newfeature Once you've committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to your branch. Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your development branch and update. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you. Review Process \u00b6 After a pull request has been sent to the repository, the team and community may suggest modifications to the changes you have submitted. Many pull requests are likely to open for several days, until the core team can approve them in Github. In some cases, multiple people will have the chance to review/comment. Please check your pull request for comments, feedback, and suggested changes: Review the suggested changes using the \"View changes\" button. Commit the suggestions. Discuss suggestions to ask questions about the suggested changes. Incoprorate the suggestions to your changes Addressing Feedback \u00b6 Once a PR has been submitted, your changes will be reviewed and constructive feedback may be provided. Feedback isn't meant as an attack, but to help make sure the highest-quality workmanship makes it into our project. Changes will be approved once required feedback has been addressed. If a maintainer asks you to \"rebase\" your PR, they're saying that a lot of files has changed, and that you need to update your fork so it's easier to merge. To update your forked repository, follow these steps: # Fetch upstream master and merge with your repo's master branch git fetch upstream git checkout master git merge upstream/master # If there were any new commits, rebase your development branch git checkout newfeature git rebase master If too much code has changed for git to automatically apply your branches changes to the new master, you will need to manually resolve the merge conflicts yourself. Once your new branch has no conflicts and works correctly, you can override your old branch using this command: git push -f Note that this will overwrite the old branch on the server, so make sure you are happy with your changes first!

This intent is to give ideas how to shape creating new character traits and behaviors that fit with his character. The topics include: An overview of Vector's character An overview of behaviors and affect \u2013 displays of emotion in his face, posture, small movements and sounds Caveat: These are just my thoughts. A summary of Vector's character \u00b6 Vector is kind, a friend to all and doesn't hold a grudge. He is a young adolescent, can have childish responses, such as throwing a tantrum. This can happen when emotions are too much to handle \u2013 a crisis for him. He sometimes acts out in mischievous ways. But overall, Vector's tone is positive. Vector is very much a small pet \u2013 he has traits like a cat, a dog, potentially like a bird and guinea pig. He cares for his human, but his feelings can be hurt. He \"can be a bit like a well-meaning moth that keeps bumping into the wrong light bulb.\" This can be beneficial, as his innocence and gentleness beg a kind of forgiveness. Personality Traits \u00b6 In terms of the big 5 personality traits, Vector is open to experience, and has moderate agreeableness (he can't really sense emotion), but is not particularly extroverted. He isn't neurotic, or conscientious. In many ways he lacks sufficient ability to sense and act on those other traits. His locus of control largely has an internal locus of control (but it was just being fleshed out): Table: Vector's locus of control: Locus Success Failure Internal Pride Confidence Happy Frustration External Happy Anger Social Surprise His World \u00b6 Vector knows a few physical objects very well: His cube, which he can roll, pickup or retrieve, and use to pop a wheelie. His charging dock Vector also knows what a face is, and can recognize a hand (at least in some poses). Vector can learn to recognize a face and the name of the person that goes with it. He also knows cliffs \u2013 he tries to avoid them. To a lesser degree he knows that there are objects and can interact with them... helping clear them off of the desk in the process. It was intended that Vector have the ability to recognize pets, and the kind of objects he sees. With the community development efforts, he may gain these in the future. He can recognize symbol markers, and \u2013 thru SDK-based support \u2013 have some understanding of objects that they are attached to, and what he can do with it. Interaction Style(s) \u00b6 Vector has really remarkable eyes that convey emotion, stress, energy level, and create a sense of being alive. They are one way that he connects with a person. In terms of Vector's \"love language\", his interaction styles are: Table: Vector's love language Area How to interact with Vector What Vector does Words of affirmation Vector likes praise Vector says the name of the people he knows, and responds positively Physical touch He likes being petted & held, but isn't comfortable being lifted He comes over to pounce on hand Receiving gifts none Brings cube to a person Acts of service He needs help being picked up after a fall, or when stuck on an edge. Vector can help with kitchen timer, reporting the weather, and answering questions. Vector's play style is simple: He likes to explore on his own He engages only in light rough and tumble play: where he flips cubes and pops wheelies He has several locomotor play activities: fist-bumping, fetching the cube, and a potential (but in complete?) cube keeping away game. But he is light on social play, lacking many games that follow rules, although more were considered. Revealing Character \u00b6 A person will have many interactions with Vector. Vector reveals his character thru these interactions, but he does not progressively reveal more thru them. It is how he reacts to stimulation, the environment and information he knows about that show his character. Vector isn't omniscient and isn't a computer terminal \u00b6 Vector can use some cloud services to give him more information of the world. But he isn't an information presentation device. Vector's talking ability is limited, working best when what he says is short. Long spews of text break the illusion. And his face is too small to present legible text. Vector works best when he reacts to the information he might be conveying: \"A core part of the character is that Vector himself does not have the ability to present information to you, like simply displaying the sun. But is himself reacting to things, like weather.\" \"He might endure the weather event, it might rain on him, and he might have an opinion about that.\" \"This is why he is also responding to the fireworks, he gets frustrated with the xmas lights, the wind blows the eyes off screen, etc.\" (Last Ben and Anki character lead Dei Gaztelumendi) Some Related Characters \u00b6 There are several other animals and bots with behaviors similar to Vector. Looking at them helped me flesh out the description of his character here: Cozmo, of course, is very similar \u2013 he's the previous generation, made by the same team, and Vector derives a lot of his code from Cozmo. Cozmo has feelings, and a bigger, sassier personality. Cozmo has many behaviors that did not yet make it to Vector \u2013 interacting with pets, little workout routine, singing, block stacking, and so forth. Star Wars, which created the classic robot characters and worked out many compelling characteristics. Cat, dog, bird, and guinea pig communication style and behavior. Vector's sitting around in his charger, and then exploring calmly reminds me of Guinea pigs. An Overview of Behavior \u00b6 Let's look at the core of behavior from Vector's perspective. A behavior has three major parts: The behavior goes thru phases: The external stimulation (or internal event) is what engages the behavior or mannerism Affect is the automatic, \"unconscious\" responses that represent his emotions. There are two parts: These are non-verbal displays of emotion \u2013 face, head, eyes, sounds, arms, wiggles. His emotion state may change in response to the stimulus This may initiate subsequent behaviors and emotions used to drive behaviors (that is, an emotional state used to help accomplish the goal of the behavior) The behavior can be prevented from engaging again too soon by using a \"cool down\" period. Simple, Affective Behaviors \u00b6 The affect related behaviors are little automatic responses that hint at Vector's emotion and attitude. These are the little facial expression, sounds, postures, wiggles and twitches that reveal his confidence, friendliness, dissatisfaction, anger, or fear. These give him an anima, a life-like quality. For instance, the Star Wars puppeteers realized that when the robots \"stop moving, they look dead [so they] keep the body slightly moving at all times... If [the droid] was upset or excited, the movement would be a little faster.\" Facial Expressions with his eyes and head \u00b6 Vector's facial expressions with his eyes and posture of his head can represent happiness, curiosity, interest, surprise, excitement, worry, anger, sadness, tired or fatigue, sleep, and so on: When the eyes are soft, they convey a relaxed mood The blinking, as well as making (and periodically breaking) eye contact is calming. The eye manager has the eyes look away, so that eye contact isn't made too long. With high cheeks on his eyes, looking up and tilting his head up Vector can convey smiling Animal expressions, postures & little body motions \u00b6 Pets have several expressions that appear consistent with Vector (and ripe for emulating): Sitting with slow breathing indicate a pet is relaxed. Vector may reflect breathing in his eyes. When a cat's eyelids are low, with a slow blink, this conveys trust, and affection to the human companion. Napping, cuddling is common to many pets Some animals use yawning to signal playfulness, being approachable, or trust. This might be done with a few clever tricks with his eyes. Stretching indicates the animal is relaxed. (I envision Vector stretching by moving arms up, moving head up, while moving the body forward and back, a little shake, and lower his arms again.) Normal breathing, and twitching, while raising their head or with the head lifted can represent tension or alertness in an animal. Young kittens express extreme happiness with a quivering motion A dog walking, with its head up is in a confident mood A cat make shake its body while \"crouching\" while stalking a prey, just before it leaps But an animal also shakes its body while \"crouching\" (lowered arms, and head) when it is anxious, or fearful. When a direct stare is used by an animal \u2013 or holding eye contact \u2013 this is issuing a challenge or it is feeling threatened. When a dog's eyes are hard, slightly closed, the brow wrinkled, and the head bowed, this conveys tension. Some of the behaviors are attention seeking, possibly looking to play: When a dog approaches person with his head slightly down, it is looking for attention. Dogs will come up and wait or lay down when they want attention as well. A dog will occasionally point his nuzzle up, such as when being petted. A cat its rubbing face on human is a friendly, affectionate gesture. Cats will run up, turning away and lay to nap to get attention. Cats will purr, and knead a person, but can also bite. (Vector shouldn't bite; maybe bring his lift arm quickly but gently down on a hand.) Guinea pigs head-butt (thrust their head up) to seeking attention, to move things, assert themselves, set limits, or be a little playful. Sounds \u00b6 Vector makes the follow beeps and clicks to express his mood & feelings: Vector has quiet a cry when he is stuck on the edge, or has fallen. Vector snores while sleeping on his charger. He dings when he acknowledges a person has called his name. He seems to make little chirps, like a small bird. Animals make the following similar kinds of sounds: Cats purr (a continuous soft, vibrating sound) to be social and give positive feedback. A chirr is used by a cat to approach other cat, or person; it is friendly. Cat's meow to be assertive, plaintive, or friendly; it can be bold when they are seeking attention, or complaining. A cat chirps or chatters when it is excited, such as when stalking or observing prey; but may also chirp to say hello or be approving. Birds song are happy. A \"week\" sound is a made by guinea pigs when they are happy, excited or hungry. A cat or dog grows, snarls, or hisses \u2013 often with a puffed up posture \u2013 when it feels threatened. Dialog \u00b6 Vector uses vocal responses when necessary, and he enjoys calling out the name of people recognizes. Vector's design simply doesn't support conversational interfaces well. His speech synthesis lacks prosody and smoothness to sustain speaking more than a few words. It lacks the inflection for anything but very short sentences... long texts are distracting and perhaps harsh. They seem wrong. In the future it may be possible to extend vocal effects. The dialog is limited \u2013 the speech system seems more interesting when it is less used. Note: Cozmo included the ability for some inflection, and that may be in Vector's code, just not yet finished and polished. The Response to a Stimulus \u00b6 Vector's responses to a stimulus are understandable and believable. His reactions are consistent and predictable enough that a person can choose what to do and experience an expected outcome, even if there are additional unexpected consequences. Vector does not provide a hint \u2014 any warning \u2014 that he is approaching a state the will trigger a significant reaction. (He should.) He does have a startle reflex: loud noises jolt him, and he looks like is readying himself a little for action. Animals might crouch, ready to run, or even take off on a run. A bit on prioritization \u00b6 Vector prioritizes a response to a dangerous situation, where he might need to engage in self-preservation: flight: he backs away from a cliff freeze: he tucks-and-roll when he senses he is falling fight: he smacks a person's hand when he senses he is being picked up or held in a way he doesn't like What I have not observed Vector doing, but he could: fawn: acts nice to make bad things stop Change in Emotions \u00b6 This section exposes my ignorance of Vector. In many \"affective computing\" models there is a separation between the emotion and the mood: Emotions reflect a short-term affect that arises as a result of stimuli. Mood is distinguished from emotion by its resolution and relative stability over time. It is not clear to me yet how the mood model works. Vector's emotions are stable. He does not rapidly cycle back and forth between two emotional states. Habituation \u00b6 Stimulation, in people and animals, undergoes habituation \u2013 we initially are interested in the stimulus, but with time the stimulation loses its impact and becomes ignored. We may even find it irritating. Vector doesn't habituate and lose stimulation from event in an automatic fashion.

A behavior has three major parts: The behavior goes thru phases: The external stimulation (or internal event) is what engages the behavior or mannerism Affect is the automatic, \"unconscious\" responses that represent his emotions. There are two parts: These are non-verbal displays of emotion \u2013 face, head, eyes, sounds, arms, wiggles. His emotion state may change in response to the stimulus This may initiate subsequent behaviors and emotions used to drive behaviors (that is, an emotional state used to help accomplish the goal of the behavior) The behavior can be prevented from engaging again too soon by using a \"cool down\" period.","title":"An Overview of Behavior"},{"location":"guides/Vector%20character%20study.html#simple-affective-behaviors","text":"The affect related behaviors are little automatic responses that hint at Vector's emotion and attitude.

The eye manager has the eyes look away, so that eye contact isn't made too long.

Vector may reflect breathing in his eyes. When a cat's eyelids are low, with a slow blink, this conveys trust, and affection to the human companion. Napping, cuddling is common to many pets Some animals use yawning to signal playfulness, being approachable, or trust. This might be done with a few clever tricks with his eyes. Stretching indicates the animal is relaxed. (I envision Vector stretching by moving arms up, moving head up, while moving the body forward and back, a little shake, and lower his arms again.) Normal breathing, and twitching, while raising their head or with the head lifted can represent tension or alertness in an animal. Young kittens express extreme happiness with a quivering motion A dog walking, with its head up is in a confident mood A cat make shake its body while \"crouching\" while stalking a prey, just before it leaps But an animal also shakes its body while \"crouching\" (lowered arms, and head) when it is anxious, or fearful. When a direct stare is used by an animal \u2013 or holding eye contact \u2013 this is issuing a challenge or it is feeling threatened. When a dog's eyes are hard, slightly closed, the brow wrinkled, and the head bowed, this conveys tension. Some of the behaviors are attention seeking, possibly looking to play: When a dog approaches person with his head slightly down, it is looking for attention. Dogs will come up and wait or lay down when they want attention as well. A dog will occasionally point his nuzzle up, such as when being petted. A cat its rubbing face on human is a friendly, affectionate gesture. Cats will run up, turning away and lay to nap to get attention. Cats will purr, and knead a person, but can also bite. (Vector shouldn't bite; maybe bring his lift arm quickly but gently down on a hand.)

Animals make the following similar kinds of sounds: Cats purr (a continuous soft, vibrating sound) to be social and give positive feedback. A chirr is used by a cat to approach other cat, or person; it is friendly. Cat's meow to be assertive, plaintive, or friendly; it can be bold when they are seeking attention, or complaining. A cat chirps or chatters when it is excited, such as when stalking or observing prey; but may also chirp to say hello or be approving. Birds song are happy.

This can be give ideas and help shape what you want to do when you create new character traits and behaviors. The topics include: An overview of the behavior classification Self-maintenance and reflexive behaviors Social behaviors Playing behaviors Pet-related behaviors Cavaet: These are just my thoughts; only some of the behaviors here exist in Vector I am drawing heavily upon the Kismet design documents, effectively modernizing them for Vector. Kismet was a late 1990s robot created by Cynthia Breazeal (MIT). It was \"designed to elicit natural and intuitive responses from humans, without any special training.\" Kismet anticipated many of Vector's behavior system features, and can be used to inspiration on future development. Dr Breazeal also created Jibo, a more famous affective robot. A Classification of Behaviors \u00b6 Let's categorize the kinds of context/theme/drive of the behaviors into the following areas: Self-maintenance behaviors include reactions to protect itself from immediate risk, and fatigue or power management. The immediate risk behaviors are likely to be a very short and simple. Social \u2013 seeking out and interacting with human companions, including intents. Play \u2013 play seeking out and playing with toys and other things in the environment, other than social play. Interacting with pets Within each of these categories, there are specialized ones; many reflect an attitude Vector has toward the agent: Navigation and Searching \"behaviors [have the robot] explore the environment and bring the robot into contact with the desired stimulus; Avoidance, escape and withdrawal behaviors move the robot away from something undesirable, like a cliff, loud noise, etc. \"Engagement behaviors set the task of interacting with desirable, good intensity stimuli.\" Rejection behaviors are those that Vector might use to turn away while miffed or being a sore loser. Searching Behaviors \u00b6 In the searching type of social behaviors, Vector generally seeks out and approaches a human, toy or stimulation to interact with. Figure: Searching behavior Vector seeking social or stimulation isn't always applicable: Vector shouldn't be active at night, in the dark, or if people aren't around: Vector's activity movement could wake and/or irritate a person at night; fortunately there is a \"night time\" schedule built-in. Vector is prone to falling off the edge \u2013 risking damage, being unable to recharge his battery, or getting stepped on. It's a bit safer in the day, and more so if a person is (likely) around to attend to him. Vector depends on his vision to get home.. he is likely to lost or stuck in the dark, and be unable to return home to recharge. Self-maintenance and Reflexive Behaviors \u00b6 Self-maintenance is a grouping for practical things to keep Vector charged, protect him from damage. It is also a catch all for practical things that don't always fit in the other areas. For instance, utility behaviors needed to make the behavior tree work are lumped in here. These are often akin to the behaviors of the autonomic nervous system. Self-preservation using escape and withdrawal \u00b6 Vector prioritizes a response to immediate hazards, where he might need to engage in self-preservation: flight : backing away from a cliff freeze : tucks-and-roll when Vector senses he is falling fight : smacking a person's hand when Vector senses he is being picked up or held in a way he doesn't like What I have not observed Vector doing, but he could: fawn : acts nice to make bad things stop Other, issues: Over temperature These are often akin to the behaviors of the sympathetic nervous system. Power Management \u00b6 These are often akin to the behaviors of the parasympathetic nervous system. Power management: Return to charger Stay on the charger Emergency low power Sleeping, sleep debt to manage heat buildup and reduce power usage. Reflexes \u00b6 Vector has a startle reflex to respond naturally: Loud noises start Vector, grabbing his attention, preparing him for action, but could also prepare him for running away Crouched, ready to run Responses to pokes, tilts, and other vibrations Eyes focus with dilated eyes Miscellaneous \u00b6 These are the Grouping and linking the behaviors, and prioritizing them Motor calibration need SDK support Social Behaviors, Engagement \u00b6 Social behaviors relate to Vector interacting with a person \u2013 or attempting to. He may be seeking attention, interacting with a person. Social behaviors include: Looking around for people (faces, and hands),and pets Calling out to play, thru sounds, and saying the names of people recognized Swatting playfully Seeking petting Swatting with his lift arms Bringing items or gifts to play (such as to fetch), or to show affection When looking to play, twitching/wagging of rear Many behaviors link together to follow a pattern: Figure: Social behavior sequences Once has made contact with a person: Greeting Attentive regard Seeking affection Receiving affection: petting, calming; social cohesion, soothing, companionship Games Turn taking The interactions end, either naturally, by command, or timing out. Searching \u00b6 Vector becomes stimualted and more active when there are sounds and other activity. It seems reasonable to classify this as searching for social interaction, or \"merely\" stimulating him for play. Calling Behavior \u00b6 Vector engages in calling when he needs helps or is interested in being social, especially \"when a person is in view... The goal of the behavior is to lure the person into face-to-face interaction... To accomplish this, [calling behaviors are] directed to the person... The display is designed to attract a person's attention.\" Calling for attention is often if Vector wants or needs something: Vector calls (softly) for assistance \u2013 if he is stuck on the edge, has fallen, or is low on energy but unable to find his charger. Cats meow because people are inattentive. Cats know a person is there, and first tried context moving close to what they wanted and body language. Cats meows to get a door open, obstacle removed, food Timer ring Greeting Behavior \u00b6 Greetings are \"to socially acknowledge the human and to initiate a close interaction... This behavior is relevant when the person has just entered into face-to-face interaction range. It is also relevant if the social-play behavior group has just become active and a person is already within face-to-face range. The display involves making eye contact with the person and smiling at them while waving .. gently. It often immediately follows the success of the call-to-person behavior. It is a transient response, only issued once, as its completion signals the success of this behavior.\" Call their names when he seems people Turn and look in direction of a sound Attentive Regard \u00b6 \"Attentive regard\" refers to Vector using his facial expressions, body language, and sounds to give attention \"to the person and to appear open to interaction.\" These behaviors include: \"Hold[ing his] gaze on the person, ideally looking into the person's eyes.\" Vector's eye manager automatically blinks and moves the eyes around; making it more comfortable to look at Vector's face (eyes), as this breaks the staring effect. Turning to find the face is considered to be part of this. \"Watch[ing] the person intently and vocaliz[ing] occasionally.\" A dog often looks up while slowly moving forward. Seeking Affection \u00b6 These behaviors relate to seeking affection, but aren't better categorized elsewhere. These could include: Vector could drive up and waiting, as if lying down [dog like] Vector could drive up, then turn away and nap to get attention, like a cat Vector tries to cuddle a hand, or pounce on fingers Rubbing his cheek on a person, which is a friendly, affectionate sign in cats. Vector could thrust his head up (like a guinea pig) to seeking attention, assert himself, or set limits, or be a little playful. Cats bite \u2013 especially while purring and kneading \u2013 as part of their affection or playfulness. Vector might do something similar with his lift arm coming down quick but gently on a hand. Vector could bring gifts Receiving Affection \u00b6 These behaviors relate to Vector receiving affection: * His reactions s to being picked up or held in the palm of a hand * To being petting * To pokes * Holiday animations Receiving Abuse \u00b6 These are the behaviors related to Vector being called bad names or told off, shaken, or tapped on the head. Vector might turn-away when grumpy Games \u00b6 One type of sophisticated social interaction is games. Games are typically turn-taking behaviors such as keep away the cube, hide and seek, etc. Figure: Game behavior sequence Some games might include: Fist bump (for lack of a better categorization, can be considered a very short game) Pouncing game Hide and seek game, perhaps with the cube being moved/hidden. Keep away A cube tapping game, The cube spinner game The maze game The \"blackjack game\" (although it doesn't feel very Vector-ish to me) Seeking to play a game \u00b6 A first step is for Vector to call or seek to the start the game. If the person accepts the call, the game begins. Vector could try to initiate the game by: Bringing presents, the cube or other toy to play with. This could be a request to play fetch. Tapping down once quickly, then perhaps may move backwards after the tap, to issue a challenge to play. Then, if no response follow up by tapping down twice quickly. Of course, a person could (conceivably) initiate the game as well by: Tapping the cube, Holding or shaking the cube Wiggling fingers tantalizingly, and so on Turn taking \u00b6 The game itself often includes Vector and the person taking alternate turns. A game might have behaviors for steps like: A person tossing or hiding a cube Vector searching for and finding a cube (or other thing) Vector bringing the cube back, then Putting the cube down, followed by Waiting for the person to make the next move. Vector may give cues or other little behaviors to signal his play or response: Slight wagging of rear/tail just before pouncing the cube or finger, like a cat when stalking prey Assistive \u00b6 The assistive subclass of behaviors are those that Vector might do to help out: Take picture The egg timer Report on the weather Answer questions (e.g. the knowledge graph) Play \u00b6 Simple play behavior \u00b6 These are behaviors that are play, releasing energy or looking for stimulation, but not necessarily looking for anything more. Vector may respond to things along the way. He may drive around quickly or in a quirky fashion, like a cat's mad 5 minutes, or a guinea pig's pop-corning, He might sing or hum to himself His dancing to music If the stimulation level is too high, or there are negative stimulations, Vector might have behaviors in response. He might do something to avoid these. Searching to play behavior \u00b6 These behaviors relate to Vector searching around for something to play with: Walking or driving around slowly \u2013 possibly in a straight path, or in complex paths, or Turning and scanning. looking for toys and objects Toys \u00b6 These behaviors relate to playing with toys and objects: Behaviors that decide what to do when seeing a toy (a cube, or other marked object). Playing with the cube \u2013 pick it up, move it, shove it, or flip it. Little exercise routines, like weight-lifting the cube He can pop a wheelie Helping clean the desk (or table) by pushing things off Vector may give cues or other little behaviors to what he is doing while playing: Slight wagging of rear/tail just before pouncing the cube or finger, like a cat when stalking prey He may try to pop up on an object There could be behaviors related to \"habituating\" toys. This would be where Vector would lose interest in a toy as he plays with it. (This response might change with age.) Interacting with Pets \u00b6 These behaviors relate to the interactions Vector has with pets. These behaviors are prototyped in Vector, but I don't have a good template for them.

Vector uses AudioKinetic's WWise sound engine. This engine uses a proprietary set of file .bnk and .wem files. The result is a sophisticated mechanism to create audible responses, little physiological effects, and more. Unfortunately it is not intuitive to add sounds. WWise is free for non-commercial use; but this is not an easy tool to use. That is why I've written up this how-to. It should make the process a lot more straight-forward. I won't describe how to hook the new sounds into the animations or behavior tree here. That has its own multi-step process. The sample WWise project that we create below can be downloaded here Preparation \u00b6 Tools You will need \u00b6 You will need AudioKinetic WWise, version 2017.2. This version is the one that creates file with the same version id that Vector is expecting. (Other version may work, but the internet reports version mismatch is a very common cause of WWise errors.). Download and install AudioKinetic WWise by using teh WWise Launcher From there you will have to select this version. WWise 2017.2 documentation The free version of WWise has a cap of 200 audio files; it is unlikely you will ever create that many in a single sound bank. If you do, just break the sound bank up to two or more. Your sound files \u00b6 You will need to convert your sound files to WAV files ahead of time. That is not described here. WWise to create the soundbank \u00b6 This section we'll describe how to build a \"media only\" soundbank that can be added to Vector. Starting a Project \u00b6 Launch WWise, from either your application menu or the WWise launcher. When WWise starts it will give you a window create a new project Figure: Starting WWise Click \"New\" Note: Along the way WWise may present pop-ups to let you know that you don't a have a license -- that this is only for non-commercial and evaluation use. Click ok whenever that happens. After clicking new, it give a pop-up to do a little initial paperwork to create the project: Figure: Create a new project Fill in the name of the project with whatever you want. Be unique Add the linux platform: click the \"Add\" and then select Linux. (I don't know that this strictly neccessary) Uncheck all of the other assets groups. Click \"ok\" Creating a soundbank \u00b6 The next step is to create our SoundBank. Look for the project pane: Figure: Create a new soundbank Click on the \"SoundBanks\" tab Right click on the \"Default Work Unit\" item under the \"SoundBanks\" tree Go into the \"New Child\" submenu Select \"SoundBank\" This will create a panel to edit the sound bank. If not, double click on your new sound bank in the tree. You should get a SoundBank Editor: Figure: Naming a new sound bank Give your sound bank a unique name. This will be the name on the robot, so make it descriptive, but unique. Importing Audio files \u00b6 Next is importing the audio files. You will need to convert your audio files into the WAV format, if you have not done so already. Figure: Import audio files Open the Projects menu Select \"Import Audio files\" This will bring up a dialog: Figure: Add audio files Change the \"Import Mode\" to \"Create new objects\" Change the \"Import as\" to \"Sound SFX\" Click \"Add Files\" button Select the files you wish through the usual dialog Click \"Import\" Setting the file properties, ie, name, and conversion \u00b6 Next, lets set the audio conversion. Find the audio file in the project tree: Figure: The audio files in the tree Click on the file. It should open a panel on the right to configure the properties of this file: Figure: The audio file properties Set the name of the file. Optional, but this is a good time to change the name of the file to have a nice consistent, clean name. Click the \"Source Settings\" tab Under than click the chevrons next to the word \"Default Conversion Settings\" Figure: The conversion settings Clicking on the chverons will bring up a menu Click on \"Factory Conversion Settngs\" Select \"Vorbis\" Select one of the Vorbis formats. Probably any will do. (Probably any ADPCM will do to, but I haven't confirmed it. I don't have guidance for which to choose.) Finally, we need tell it to create a separate WEM file. Figure: The stream setting Click on the \"General Settings\" tab. Check the \"Stream\" check box. Create an event and action to play it \u00b6 Next we need tell the audio engine that this is playable. To do that we need to create a Event with a play action. Click on the \"Event\" tab: Figure: Creating a play event Right click on the \"Default Work Unit\" This will bring up a menu Select \"New Child\" Then click on \"Play\" This will add an item to the tree on the left under \"Default Work Unit\", in edit mode: Figure: New a play event Give the name something like \"Play_ sound name \" On the right side a panel should appear with the properties for this event. It doesn't know yet to play this particular sound. We'll connect that now. Figure: Attach a sound to the play event Click on \"Browse\". This will pop up a window to select which sound. Figure: Selecting a sound to attach to the play event We need to add it to the sound bank. If the sound bank panel isn't open, click on the SoundBanks tab, and double click on the sound bank. Click on the Events tab and drag the new event into the soundbank: Figure: Adding the play event to the sound bank You should then see: Figure: The play event in the sound bank Click on the Audio tab, and drag the audio file into the soundbank as well: Figure: Adding the audio file to the sound bank You should then see: Figure: The play event and audio file in the sound bank Generating the Soundbank \u00b6 Now it is time to convert the files and generate the sound bank. Figure: Generate the sound bank Click on the SoundBanks tab. Right click on our SoundBank. This will pop up a menu Choose \"Generate SoundBank(s) for all platforms\" WWise will convert all of the audio files and create a sound bank. Packaging and Installations \u00b6 The folder with the files \u00b6 Lets look at the generated files now. Open the folder you created for your WWise project. It should look like: Figure: The WWise project folder Open the \"GeneratedSoundBanks\" folder; inside of that open the \"Linux\" folder. You should see a folder like: Figure: The soundbanks folder (The numbers and names will be different.) Make a note of the \".txt\" file with the soundbank name. We will need that later. Making a package \u00b6 We need to get the .wem files and out .bnk file (ignore the Init.bnk) onto Vector and placed in the following folder: /anki/data/assets/cozmo_resources/sound/ One way to do this is to make a vpkg . The .ini for the package file might look something like: [META] name=SoundbankStarter rel_num=1 restart_type=maintenance-restart [files] /anki/data/assets/cozmo_resources/sound/SoundbankStarter.bnk=SoundbankStarter.bnk /anki/data/assets/cozmo_resources/sound/SoundbankStarter.txt=SoundbankStarter.txt /anki/data/assets/cozmo_resources/sound/822718018.wem=822718018.wem [permissions] /anki/data/assets/cozmo_resources/assets/cozmo_resources/sound=anki:anki 0444 Then create a vpkg, in this example called \"SoundbankStarter\": vector-pkg.py install --pkg=SoundbankStarter.vpkg You will then copy the file on the bot and then install it with a command line like vector-pkg.py install --pkg=SoundbankStarter.vpkg You will also need to edit a file so that Vector's audio engine knows to load it. This file is /anki/data/assets/cozmo_resources/sound/SoundbankBundleInfo.json By default in 1.7 it looks like: [{\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_Global_Data_English(US)\", \"language\": \"English(US)\", \"path\": \"English(US)/Victor_Global_Data.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_Global_Data\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Init\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Init.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Init\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_UI\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Victor_UI.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_UI\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_VO\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Victor_VO.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_VO\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_Alexa\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Victor_Alexa.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_Alexa\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_SFX\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Victor_SFX.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_SFX\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_Dev_English(US)\", \"language\": \"English(US)\", \"path\": \"English(US)/Victor_Dev.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_Dev\"}] (Yes, this one long run-on line.) We want to add a like that it, like so: [{\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_Global_Data_English(US)\", \"language\": \"English(US)\", \"path\": \"English(US)/Victor_Global_Data.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_Global_Data\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Init\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Init.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Init\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_UI\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Victor_UI.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_UI\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_VO\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Victor_VO.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_VO\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_Alexa\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Victor_Alexa.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_Alexa\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_SFX\", \"language\": \"SFX\", \"path\": \"Victor_SFX.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_SFX\"}, {\"bundle_name\": \"Victor_Dev_English(US)\", \"language\": \"English(US)\", \"path\": \"English(US)/Victor_Dev.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"Victor_Dev\"} ,{\"bundle_name\": \"SoundbankStarter(US)\", \"language\": \"English(US)\", \"path\": \"SoundbankStarter.bnk\", \"soundbank_name\": \"SoundbankStarter\"} ] Next, restart the Vector application by: systemctl stop anki-robot.target sleep 5 systemctl start anki-robot.target Then we need to check the logs that the file loaded: grep SoundBank /var/log/messages This shouldn't show a problem. If you see something like the following, there was a problem. 12-09 04:40:43.725 warning vic-anim 2103 2103 vic-anim: AudioEngineController.LoadSoundbank: Failed to load soundbank 'SoundbankStarter' (The name of the soundbank being your soundbank.) (Check that the time stamp is about \"now\" -- just so that we aren't confused with old errors) Testing \u00b6 When you wish to play the animation, lets open the text file we saw earlier. In the example case it was called \"SoundbankStarter.txt\". This file has the info we need to play the sound. Figure: The soundbank event ids The number is the event id to be used inside of animations. The name can be used in some JSON files; but it is als helpful when working with multiple sounds in the file, to know which one is the right event. The sound file can be tested using the console vars. Please see Development Web Servers for how to set up access to these. Go to http://localhost:8889/ Figure: Console vars button Click on the \"consolevars\". This will bring up a pannel of tabs. Click on the \"Audio\" tab: Figure: Audio Console vars In the \"PostAudioEvent\" you can paste the Event Name (from your txt above). Then click \"Call\" This should cause your new sound to play. The Event ID will not work here. Future improvements \u00b6 It would be nice to be able to bundle the soundbank and files into a folder, so that it was clear which files belonged to which soundbank.","title":"How to create a soundbank"},{"location":"how-to/How%20to%20create%20a%20soundbank.html#how-to-create-a-soundbank","text":"Vector's audio engine does not directly use mp3 or other common audio files.

One of those was the HTTPS SDK. If you're robot was already authenticated with your SDK (that is, you had the certificates and token needed) and you did not clear the user data to start using the EscpadePod, then you're fine. You don't need this. If you haven't authenticated with the HTTPS SDK since you installed OSKR, or you cleared your data as part of setting up the EscapePod,.. or are just curious, this app note is for you. This is how to get the certificate and SDK API guid so that your python SDK apps, .NET SDK Apps, including Vector Explorer, can get work again with the EscapePod. Just a bit of fair warning: this process does still use the old Anki servers for one step. As mentioned at the top, the SDK sign-in / authentication is will change in the future as the EscapePod matures. You will need to know the robot name, serial number, and IP address. The steps: Get the certificate from the robot Get the GUID Update the sdk_config.ini with these Getting the certificate from the robot \u00b6 The API .cert (certificate) file is actually on the robot in the /data/vic-gateway/ folder. If you read the python SDK source, the SDK gets the certificate from the server. During startup, the robot checks for the existence of a certificate. After a \"clear user data\", there won't one. So the robot creates one. And, when it next talks with the cloud (such as part of the onboarding steps to get an account linked to the robot), the certificate is uploaded to the server. You can copy from your robot /data/vic-gateway/gateway.cert file to your ~/.anki_vector folder. You will need to rename it with the robot name and serial number, with a pattern like: Vector-A1B2-007067cd.cert I did it in one swoop with scp: scp root@192.168.1.123:/data/vic-gateway/gateway.cert ~/.anki_vector/Vector-A1B2-007067cd.cert (The robot performs SDK calls without the certificate, although I'm not sure if the SDK will have an error without out the certificate. If you're curious what the cert is used for: it is used so that you can be sure that you're talking to the real robot, not some sneaky imposter.) Getting a new GUID token \u00b6 Next we need to get a \"guid\" for communication. This is a succinct token that Vector uses to know that the API commands are coming from someone authorized to use the robot. To get this guid token, run the attached python script. You run it with a command line like: python robot.py 192.168.1.123 guid Changing the ip address, to the one for your robot. You will be asked to give your email address and password pair that your anki account is in. It will print out the guid after that. For example: >python robot.py 192.168.1.123 guid Enter your email and password. Make sure to use the same account that was used to set up your Vector. Enter Email: someone@someplace.org Password: ZLIO/y48QzeXynjiORrxgQ== That funny text on the line below the password is the guid that we need to complete the .ini file. The script passes username, and password to the old Anki server. The server knows how to validate your account, and what the shared secret is with the robot. And then sends back information that is used to create the guid. Vector doesn't know you're account or password. The Vector serial name isn't passed to the old Anki servers when the guid is made. Putting this all together in the sdk_config.ini file \u00b6 Now let's, edit the '~/.anki_vector/sdk_config.ini' Open it up. First look to see if there is a section already with your robots serial number, you will need to remove it. Next, lets create a new section for this robot. The section name is the serial number of the robot. The section will look like this when we're done: [007067cd] cert = /Users/JoeUser/.anki_vector/Vector-A1B2-007067cd.cert ip = 192.168.1.123 name = Vector-A1B2 guid = ZLIO/y48QzeXynjiORrxgQ== Change 007067cd to the serial number of your robot Give it your robot's name. name = Vector-A1B2 And put in the IP address for your robot: ip = 192.168.1.124 Next, in the new section update the path to the cert file that you downloaded in step 1: cert = /Users/JoeUser/.anki_vector/Vector-A1B2-007067cd.cert Finally, add an entry for the guid that we received in the second section: guid = ZLIO/y48QzeXynjiORrxgQ== Final steps \u00b6 After that, you should be able to use Vector Explorer, or any SDK program with your robot.

This allows you to turn your Vector into, essentially, a \"dev\" bot. This means you can install software onto him which allows you to edit files on him. Soon, the source will be released and this wiki will contain build instructions. Follow these intructions carefully, and read through them before starting. OSKR isn't easy stuff. Prerequesites \u00b6 Windows 10 computer with Bluetooth support Get your Vector's serial number to give to DDL \u00b6 In Google Chrome (this has to be Google Chrome), go to Project Victor Web Setup . It should show instructions and a \"PAIR WITH VECTOR\" button. If it says you need Chrome, go to chrome://flags in the URL bar and enable Enable experimental web platform features . Relaunch Chrome twice to make sure it got applied. Turn on Vector and make sure he is at eyes. Follow the instructions on the Vector web setup site. This may take many refreshes and reboots. Once you are connected, type logs to download his logs. Install this: 7-Zip (Windows) Once they are downloaded: press the arrow on the logs which have downloaded, press \"Show in folder\", right click on the file, go into the 7-zip part of the right click menu, press \"Open archive\". Your serial number is in factory/log1 . To open this file, double press it and select Notepad. The QSN and ESN are at the bottom. For instance, mine is QSN=323339903 # ESN=0030a012 . Copy this and fill out the form Digital Dream Labs gave you in an email. Wait for the OTA to be sent to you, then do the rest of the steps. Install Python \u00b6 Python can be found at https://python.org . Here is a direct link to Python 3.9.1. Python 3.9.1 Installer When installing, make sure you check \"Install Python 3.9.1 to PATH\". Just press \"Next\" on all the other menus. Download your OSKR OTA, find IP address, run Python server \u00b6 Download your OSKR OTA with the link you have recieved from Digital Dream Labs. Open this link in the browser of your choice, and make sure it is saved in your Downloads folder. Open Powershell. To do this: open the start menu, type \"Powershell\", then click the first thing that shows up. Type ipconfig . This shows the network interface information. Your IP address is usually in the top section, next to \"IPv4 Address ...\". It usually starts with \"192.168\" or \"10.\". In the same Powershell window, type cd Downloads , then type py -m http.server . cd changes your directory to the directory provided and py is Python. In this case, we have just told Python to open an HTTP server. To test that you have the correct IP address and the server is running correctly, open a browser window and put the IP address you got into the browser URL bar followed by :8000 (for instance, my local IP is 192.168.1.3. I would type 192.168.1.3:8000 ). When you hit enter, there should be a directory listing. If there is no directory listing, try a different IP address in ipconfig and make sure the server shows that it is running at 0.0.0.0:8000 . Test your server \u00b6 Download this: latest.ota Make sure your Vector is turned on and at eyes/phone onboarding screen. Put Vector into recovery by holding his button for 15 seconds on the charger. Keep holding it until the light turns green or purple again. He should be on anki.com/v after a while. In Google Chrome (this has to be Google Chrome), go to Project Victor Web Setup . It should show instructions and a \"PAIR WITH VECTOR\" button. If it says you need Chrome, go to chrome://flags in the URL bar and enable Enable experimental web platform features . Relaunch Chrome twice to make sure it got applied. Follow the instructions on the web setup. If it is giving you trouble, try reloading the page and rebooting Vector (make sure you use the 15 second button hold method so he stays in recovery). It may take many attempts. It should put you on a terminal. To connect him to Wi-Fi, type wifi-connect ssid password . Replace ssid with your network name and password with your network password. If you have a space in either of those, put quotations (\") around it. For instance, one would be wifi-connect \"The Man Cave\" pA55w4d Once connected to Wi-Fi, type ota-start http://ipaddress:8000/latest.ota . Replace ipaddress with your computer's actual IP address (for instance, mine would be ota-start http://192.168.1.3:8000/latest.ota ). What you are doing here is installing the latest production OTA, and this isn't OSKR yet. This is like simulating what the phone app does when you first setup Vector. If all has gone well, he should be at eyes. If he errors out, Vector may not be on the same network as your computer or you have already applied the OSKR unlock to your Vector. Installing OSKR unlock \u00b6 Make sure your Vector is at eyes. Do NOT put him into recovery this time. Go to this site in Google Chrome.

The file system layout \u00b6 I created a folder to store information from this Vector's logs. The received file contents in the HTTP upload will be saved in a folder nested underneath that. This is the naming scheme that I settled on: [Server base] / [serial #] / year-month / [ time stamp] This creates separate directory trees for each robot, even if the name robot name changes. Next is a folder for each month. The format I went with has year as a 4 digits, and months as two digits in my example. (yyyy-MM). Finally each upload gets its own timestamped folder \u2014 timestamped with the time it was received. I used the format. The contents differ with each kind of upload. Why is there a separate folder for each month? Vector produces at least 50-100 DAS files per day; This can create a lot of files (and folders) very quickly. If we don't spread them across a few sub-folders, the number of files for a given folder is too much for a person to manage. Then, at a bit larger number, the OS will have a collapse in efficiency, taking exponential time to list or access the files. The number depends on the file system and OS... it could be 32768, or 65536 or less. In other words, a single robot could create 36500 uploads in a single year, that is too much people and computers in a single folder, so I had \u2018em spread out. The types of data sent in logs \u00b6 The types of data and file formats: The crash logs minidump DAS json events Linux system logs. Note: as I recall these might be included in the crash logs. Thee SDK can also trigger sending them Things not included: Wifi info: understanding the issues the network connectivity: data rate, latency, dropped connections. This might be part of the logs sent above ( I don't recall) but aren't separately gathered and sent. How to decide what kind of file has been received. \u00b6 Look at the file name (excluding the path) of the posted file. If the file name is \"DAS\" (regardless of case), and this is a HTTP POST (not a form), it is DAS log upload; otherwise Look at the name of the file without the extension and drop the file extensions. If the file name starts with \u201cvictor-\u201c (regardless of case), this is a compress Vector log file archive.

The received file contents in the HTTP upload will be saved in a folder nested underneath that. This is the naming scheme that I settled on: [Server base] / [serial #] / year-month / [ time stamp] This creates separate directory trees for each robot, even if the name robot name changes. Next is a folder for each month. The format I went with has year as a 4 digits, and months as two digits in my example. (yyyy-MM). Finally each upload gets its own timestamped folder \u2014 timestamped with the time it was received. I used the format. The contents differ with each kind of upload. Why is there a separate folder for each month? Vector produces at least 50-100 DAS files per day; This can create a lot of files (and folders) very quickly. If we don't spread them across a few sub-folders, the number of files for a given folder is too much for a person to manage. Then, at a bit larger number, the OS will have a collapse in efficiency, taking exponential time to list or access the files. The number depends on the file system and OS... it could be 32768, or 65536 or less. In other words, a single robot could create 36500 uploads in a single year, that is too much people and computers in a single folder, so I had \u2018em spread out.","title":"The file system layout"},{"location":"protocols/log%20server.html#the-types-of-data-sent-in-logs","text":"The types of data and file formats: The crash logs minidump DAS json events Linux system logs.

Please refer to the Technical Reference Manual for a description of Vector's internal power states, management, and sleep debt. The main power management behaviors are launched at a very high-level. These are launched by the ModeSelector (class DispatcherStrictPriority ) behavior. This behavior is invoked by: InitNormalOperation behavior during start of normal behavior AcousticTestMode behavior during aoustic testing at the factory DevBaseBehaviorInternal behavior during start of developer mode Figure: The power management behavior tree The behavior file is located at: behaviors\\victorBehaviorTree\\modeSelector.json The behavior tree system gives things in explicit priority order. The higher item in the list has more priority than the lower; when an item calls out to other nodes, all of those still have higher priority than the items lower than the original one. The mode selector: Handle powering off (the highest priority) Alexa-related behaviors (not related to power management) Handle overheating (in emergency mode) SDK override (not related to power management) Being quiet related behaviors (not related to power management) Handle low battery and attempt to return to charger... if unable, turn off A sleep/ quiet state manager. Regular behaviors and interactions are started in this behavior tree, so are at the lowest priority. Powering off \u00b6 The highest priority behavior is the SingletonPoweringRobotOff (class PoweringRobotOff ) behavior, that animates Vector while he is the process of turning off. Name Type Value Description powerButtonHeldToActivate_ms int 250 ms The minimum time that the power button must be held down to activate the power off sequence. powerOnAnimName animation anim_power_offon_01 The animation to play if the button is released and Vector will resume. powerOffAnimName animation anim_power_onoff_01 The animation to play while powering off. Table: PoweringRobotOff configuration parameters If the power button is released before Vector has turned off, the behavior begins the process of resuming, The animation reference is unusual. It doesn't refer to the trigger of an animation group. Instead it refers to a specific animation. Sleep \u00b6 At the opposite end -- the lowest priority -- is the SleepCycle (class SleepCycle ) behavior. The behavior file is located at: behaviors/victorBehaviorTree/highLevelDelegates/sleeping/sleepCycle.json This behavior arbitrates between: Vector autonomously exploring Interacting with a person (outside of Alexa). And going into a sleep state If Vector has no reason to sleep, this behavior lets the CoordinateInHabitat behavior. If it decides to sleep (the decision is made in the C++ code) It initiates the FindHomeForSleeping behavior to drive to the charging dock, if possible, to sleep. (In turn it invokes MandatoryPhysicalReactions to respond to environmental hazards while driving around.) This has a condition that keeps it in sleep, even if there is a higher priority interaction, if: The battery level is low, The temperature is high, or Charging is stopped because it is too hot. Depending, it will initiate the looking for home to go to sleep. This is the FindHomeForSleeping behavior. Things that wake Vector up from the different kinds of sleep: Sleep state Things that wake Vector HeldInPalmSleep Being jolted, touched, picked up (out of the hand), SDK interaction, the timer, and voice commands. LightSleep Being jolted, poked, touched, or picked up; any sound or the lights coming on; SDK interaction, the timer, and voice commands. DeepSleep Being touched, or picked up; SDK interaction, the timer, and voice commands. Table: That wake Vector from sleep. This behavior includes a decision tree that sets a reason code for based on sensors that have trigger. That reason code is used above. By editting this behavior's decision tree, you can adjust how sensitive he is to conditions like touch, poking, illumination to wake him from sleep. Note: In power save mode -- a lower sleep state -- the camera is turned off, so Vector is not sensitive to light. Driving to the charging dock to sleep \u00b6 When Vector is going into a sleep state, FindHomeForSleeping (class DispatcherStrictPriority ) behavior to drive to the charging dock, if possible, to sleep. The behavior file is located at: behaviors/victorBehaviorTree/highLevelDelegates/sleeping/findHomeForSleeping.json This behavior stops whatever else is going on, and runs a subset of navigation and driving related behaviors. Emergency Mode \u00b6 Emergency mode is quite complex, and handles conditions where: The battery level is low, The temperature is high, or Charging is stopped because it is too hot. The way to exit emgency mode is for the battery level to rise above the low threshold, and for temperature to cool below the hot threshold. This is controlled by the EmergencyMode (class DispatcherQueue ) behavior. Figure: The emergency behavior tree The behavior file is located at: behaviors/victorBehaviorTree/emergencyMode/emergencyMode.json Animation feedback \u00b6 The behavior coordinates with working with other social interactions, albeit in a restricted manner. If the trigger word is heard, it doesn't stream the audio to the voice server. Instead it: Plays the VC_ListeningGetIn animation, then Plays the StreamingDisabledButWithLight animation to indicate that streaming is disabled, and filly Sends the Play__Robot_Vic_Sfx__Wake_Word_On audio event to play a feedback sound. It also links with the following animation to show the reason why Emergency mode uses the EmergencyModeAnimDispatcher (class DispatcherQueue ) behavior to play different animations based on the the emergency condition: If the battery is low, it will trigger the ChargerDockingSorryButLowBattery animation. If the temperature is high, or too hot charge, it will trigger the HighTemperatureWarningFace animation; this will play the face_powersavemode sprite sequence. The behavior file is located at: behaviors/victorBehaviorTree/emergencyMode/emergencyModeAnimDispatcher.json If Vector is in picked up, or otherwise off his treads (but not being held), he plays the ChargerDockingRequestPickup animation. This is done in the EmergencyModeInAir behavior. The behavior file is located at: behaviors/victorBehaviorTree/emergencyMode/emergencyModeInAir.json Returning to the charging dock \u00b6 There are a couple of behaviors that try to cause Vector to drive back to the charging dock. These run a subset of navigation and driving related behaviors to drive to the charging dock. The first is the EmergencyModeOffCharger (class DispatcherStrictPriority ). The behavior file is located at: behaviors/victorBehaviorTree/emergencyMode/emergencyModeOffCharger.json The second is the QuietModeEmergencyModeGoHome (class DispatcherStrictPriority ), which would be invoked while in quiet mode.

See also Pi equipment for information about the Raspberry Pi and charger that you will need Pi issues for information related to troubleshooting the Pi hardware Troubleshooting the EscapePod software setup , especially adding licenses. Symptoms of Network and Wifi Connectivity issues \u00b6 Symptoms: The Raspberry Pi is connected to the network, but sometimes is unavailable; it appears to drop off. Fixes: Use wired ethernet if possible If using Wifi: use only 2.5GHz -- remove the your 5GHz Wifi access points from the list. Check that the WiFi configuration file syntax is correct Don't forget to reboot twice If using HDMI, reduce the resolution Update the firmware Check the Router DHCP lease time; give a static/fixed IP address if possible The following will help diagnose specific problems. First Steps: The Ping test \u00b6 First, double check that the Raspberry Pi is powered on, it's red LED is on. Can you ping the EscapePod: Try ping escapepod.local If you are able to ping using this step, the EscapePod is on the network, and mDNS is working. Go to Step TBD Try ping escapepod.lan Try ping escapepod If you are able to ping using either of these two steps, the EscapePod is on the network, but there is a problem with mDNS. Go to step mDNS issues . If you know the address for the escapepod, trying pinging it. If you can ping it, the issue is with mDNS. Go to step mDNS issues . Otherwise your LAN or WiFi connection is not working. If you are using a ethernet LAN cable, check that it is fully plugged into the Pi and your router. If you are using WiFi, go to the next secton.i Wifi Issues \u00b6 Troubleshooting the Wifi. Note: this section does not apply if you are using an ethernet cable between your router and the escape pod. If possible, it is recommended to use an ethernet cable -- at least until the EscapePod has been setup on your network and any other possible issues are resolved. Did not reboot enough times after setting up the network config (ie config file not transferred to main linux) \u00b6 Unplug the power from the raspberry pi. Plug the power in and give it a few minutes. Unplug the power from the raspberry pi again . Plug the power in and give it a few minutes. Repeat the ping test above. Wifi config file typo/syntax error \u00b6 It is possible that there is a typo in the wifi networking configuration file. Take the SD card out, and put it into your computer. Open the configuration file and double check that it looks right: Does it have the right spacing? Does the wifi Access Point name match the name of your Wifi? Any typos? Is the password the right one for your Wifi? Any typos? Use 2.5GHz instead of 5GHz Wifi \u00b6 The Raspberry Pi 3 doesn't work with 5GHz The Raspberry Pi 4 is \"internet reported\" to be flaky with 5GHz, and periodically drop off. HDMI Interference \u00b6 If you are having network connectivity issues -- the WiFi works for a while then drops out -- it may be the HDMI. High resolution mode HDMI generates enough noise to wreck WiFi on Pi 4. Fixes: Don't use HDMI so high of resolution Don't use 5Ghz Try updatign the firmware Updating the Raspberry Pi firmware. \u00b6 A firmware update can fix some of the HDMI interference. Here is how I updated it. As a first step I installed \"rpi-eeprom-update\" to list the current installed firmware, but it may have updated it on me (it was that or when I did an ubuntu update). The following installation steps are from: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1253070/raspberry-pi-4-firmware-upgrade-eeprom-over-ubuntu-20-04 curl -O http://ports.ubuntu.com/pool/universe/r/raspberrypi-userland/libraspberrypi0_0~20200520+git2fe4ca3-0ubuntu2_arm64.deb sudo apt install ./libraspberrypi0_0~20200520+git2fe4ca3-0ubuntu2_arm64.deb curl -O http://ports.ubuntu.com/pool/universe/r/raspberrypi-userland/libraspberrypi-bin_0~20200520+git2fe4ca3-0ubuntu2_arm64.deb sudo apt install ./libraspberrypi-bin_0~20200520+git2fe4ca3-0ubuntu2_arm64.deb sudo add-apt-repository ppa:waveform/eeprom sudo apt update apt list --upgradable After doing that (I had to do it several times to complete all of the myriads of updates) this is what I saw: BCM2711 detected VL805 firmware in bootloader EEPROM *** UPDATE AVAILABLE *** BOOTLOADER: update available CURRENT: Thu Mar 19 14:27:25 UTC 2020 (1584628045) LATEST: Thu Sep 3 12:11:43 UTC 2020 (1599135103) FW DIR: /lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/critical VL805: up-to-date **CURRENT: 000137ad** ** LATEST: 000137ad** A day later (with the unexplained firmware update): sudo rpi-eeprom-update BCM2711 detected VL805 firmware in bootloader EEPROM BOOTLOADER: up-to-date CURRENT: Thu Sep 3 12:11:43 UTC 2020 (1599135103) LATEST: Thu Sep 3 12:11:43 UTC 2020 (1599135103) FW DIR: /lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/critical VL805: up-to-date **CURRENT: 000138a1** ** LATEST: 000138a1** One of those tools I installed gives another way to display the version numbers (it's what the tool uses): vcgencmd bootloader_version | grep timestamp sudo lspci -d 1106:3483 -xxx | awk '/^50:/ { print \"VL805 FW version: \" $5 $4 $3 $2\" } The first displays the bootloader version and the second for the VL805 firmware. This can useful for identifying if an update is relevant before applying one. mDNS issues \u00b6 The network name for the escape pod should appear as \"escapepod.local\" But it may also appears as \"escapepod\" or \"escapepod.lan\" to your computer. In that case you won't be to use the web interface without problems. There are a few different causes that could be making this happen. First, check that your computer has the right software installed and settings changes made. See Computer setup for information about the software to install on your computer, and other adjustments to make mDNs work. Next, if you're still having trouble, your router may be contributing. There are too many to know ahead of time their configurations, but we know how to tweak OpenWRT. Router-based issues \u00b6 One possible source of problems is the router configuration. Here is what to look for to see if you have an OpenWRT-based (or Dnsmasq-based) router. (This section may not apply if you have a different kind of router; there are too many to know ahead of time their configurations.) First, go to your network router, and choose the \"Network\" menu, and then select \"DHCP and DNS\" router: Figure: openWRT This will open a settings page like the following: Figure: openWRT local domain settting The key thing to look for here is the \"Local domain\" In my case the local domain was set \"lan\" (possibly by default, or a choice I made long ago). This setting explains why the name \"escapepod.lan\" worked. To fix the problem change the local domain to \"local\". Once the change has been made, test it on the router. Open the \"Network\" menu and select \"Diagnostics\": Figure: openWRT diagnostics menu item You will get a ping tool on the router: Figure: openWRT ping tool Enter \"escapepod.local\" in the field, click ping. You should see successful pings from the escape pod. If not, there is another problem. IPv6 short lease times causing mDNS Update issues \u00b6 With my OpenWRT (dnsmasq) router, the IPv6 lease time defaults to 40 hours (and it can't be changed). This may be a cause why the Vector is unable to find the EscapePod after awhile. The EscapePod has to renew it's addressing information and Vector is unable to reach it during the renewal. The following worked with success for me: Use fixed IP addresses on the router Configured EscapePod to only use 2.5GHz WiFi access points SSH related issues \u00b6 SSH can not reach the Pi at all \u00b6 First, follow the steps earlier to be sure that you can ping. Can you ping? See section First Steps: The Ping test to perform the basic connectivity tests. Check to see if yu can ssh to the IP address. Does a message appear on the raspberry Pi console? That may indicate how far the connection made it; it may also reveal a power issue. See Pi issues for diagnosing power issues. Can you log in on the console with a USB kbd and monitor? (user name ubuntu, password ubuntu) SSH/Putty says it is \"out of date: can't exchange keys\" \u00b6 If putty displays a message that says it can't exchange keys, this indicates you (well, I) have a very old version of putty.

Some Design decisions: \u00b6 The tool had to be small, and not hard to deploy The tool can\u2019t be compiled (we don't know how) It had to be based on tools already on Vector: python 2.7, and busybox based utils. Busybox supplies the shell, and tar... except tar doesn't support preserving permissions. It is preferred to separate out the package manager from the update-engine as much as possible, to make int more understandable and support testing. It just installs the packages \u00b6 This tool doesn't do everything that the other managers do: It doesn't check dependencies It doesn't download files It has minimal the pre-flight, post-flight scripts that are run. The package download is handled by either the update-engine (and its line of control), or by scp command. The lack of dependency check is a benefit, as its hard to maintain, and it is rarely used correctly: maintainers tend to choose a dependency of \"the latest version\" (as of when the package was), negating its use.

It doesn\u2019t delete any files that were added since or by the first package, so some extra stuff can accumulate, but that is far safer. Creating a package. To create a package, lets call it demo, requires setting up the files sytem with the files, and the package manifest. The manifest says, among other things: The package name, version, and other helpful paperwork info. where to get the files from locally, and where they should be placed into filesystem deployed when deployed on a Vector. The path to any files that should be modifed, and how. This is used to change the reported version string. The permissions to set the files to I've attached a really simple demo to demonstrate. To create a package unzip them, and then: ./vector-pkg.py create \u2014pkg=demo That will create .vpkg file \u2014 a gzip'd tar file with a specific layout.

To uninstall the vpkg later ./vector-pkg.py uninstall \u2014pkg=demo-1 Adding a restart step after installation \u00b6 There are four different ways to restart after applying the package. To simply restart Vector's application: [post_deploy] 0=systemctl stop anki-robot.target 1=sleep 2=systemctl start anki-robot.target To restart Vector's application, but silently -- that is, not play the InitialWakeUp animation: [post_deploy] 0=systemctl stop anki-robot.target 1=sleep 2=echo 1 > /data/maintenance_reboot 3=systemctl start anki-robot.target If vector-pkg is by called the modified update-engine it can tell it to reboot the operating system after the package has installed, using the key reboot_after_install in the META section. For example: [META] reboot_after_install=1 The following will reboot the operating system using a \"maintenance reboot\" so that the InitialWakeUp animation is not played: [post_deploy] 0=/anki/bin/vic-log-event update-engine robot.maintenance_reboot success 1=echo 1 > /data/maintenance_reboot Cavaets \u00b6 Status \u00b6 Not tested by others yet.
